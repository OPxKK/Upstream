# Upstream-Website
Here is the website, named Upstream which is created by me, using web developing languages namely HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap 5, Javascript. This website Upstream has been properly developed using these mentioned languages, using the rightful ideas and information, Upstream has its own benefits to its users, it is just a interface. It is responsive in its behaviours. There are most of important stuffs that helped me build this website in best way possible, namely

1.) Google Fonts:- One can have the best fonts for his/her website in every style depending on the Idea.

2.) Fonts Awesome:- This mainly provides user to get better thumbnails , icons of everything. for e.g., instagram logo, facebook logo, etc.

3.) Favicon Generator:- Being precise, favicon is a must and every professional website will have its favicon desgined in its own particular way.

4.) HTML Tree Generator:- The Tree extension is available is almost every browser on the Internet, one can use it. It basically helps the developer to analyze the code more faster.
